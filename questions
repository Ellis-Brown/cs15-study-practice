Comp 15 Midterm review general questions. This does not cover all content on the midterm,
but goes over some questions that are important to understand.

1) Describe the benefits and negatives of using the following data structures, and one time you would use them

    a) Linked list
        a1) circular buffer

    b) ArrayList

    c) Stack

    d) Queue

    e) Binary Search Tree



2) Define invariants:

    a) Describe the invariants of a binary tree

    b) Describe the invariants of a stack

    c) Describe the invariants of a queue

    d) Describe the invariants of a single linked list

    e) Describe the invariants of a double linked list

    f) Describe the invariants of a vector/ArrayList






4) Binary tree.

    a) Insert the following elements into a in order binary tree

        1, 4 , 3 , 7 , 2 , 0 , 9 , 14

        a1) is it balenced? Why or why not?

    b) What is the runtime of finding the smallest element?

    c) What is an inorder traversal? What would the outcome be?

    d) What is a post order traversal? What would the outcome be?

    e) What is a pre order traversal? What would the outcome be?

    f) Remove the root from the tree. Use any element that satisifies the binary tree's invariance

    g) What is an AVL tree? Why would we use it? *if you don't know, search it up online. please know this!*

5) Purpose.

    a) What would a good purpose be for the following classes? (written at top of file)
        a1) DatumStack
        a2) MetroSim
        a3) Passenger
        a4) CirrcularBuffer
    
6) Keywords

    a) define Modularity. Why is it important?
    
    b) define encapsulation. Why is it important?

7) other

    What does this code do? (assume it compiles)

        int main() {
            int *ptr = new int[3];
            ptr[0] = 3;
            foo(ptr);
            std::cout << ptr[0]
        }
        void foo(int *ptr) {
            ptr = nullptr;
        }
