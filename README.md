# Comp 15 Tufts Reviews

Here are some reviews for the COMP15 midterm and final. These are not the official course study guides, but rather written by me, and students have found them very helpful in past semesters. All review / practice questions written here were NOT written in coordination with the writing of the exam. 


> The topics covered may not perfectly match up to the current semester, make sure you know what will be and won't be on the exam
